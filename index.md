# AutoHeal Locator

**AutoHeal Locator** is an enterprise-grade AI-powered element locator with auto-healing capabilities for **Java** test automation using **Selenium WebDriver** and **Playwright**. When your test selectors break due to DOM changes, AutoHeal uses advanced AI models to intelligently locate elements and keep your tests running.

```{note}
AutoHeal Locator is designed for production environments and provides robust, cost-effective test automation with minimal maintenance.
```

## Quick Examples

### Selenium WebDriver
```java
// Create AutoHeal locator for Selenium
AutoHealLocator locator = new AutoHealLocator.Builder()
    .withWebAdapter(new SeleniumWebAutomationAdapter(driver))
    .withConfiguration(AutoHealConfiguration.builder()
        .aiConfig(AIConfig.builder()
            .apiKey("your-openai-key")
            .build())
        .build())
    .build();

// Find element with AI-powered healing
WebElement button = locator.findElement("#submit-btn", "Submit button");
button.click();
```

### Playwright
```java
// Create AutoHeal locator for Playwright
PlaywrightWebAutomationAdapter adapter = new PlaywrightWebAutomationAdapter(page);
AutoHealLocator locator = new AutoHealLocator(adapter);

// Same API - AutoHeal handles framework differences
WebElement button = locator.findElement("#submit-btn", "Submit button");
button.click();
```
